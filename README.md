Masquerade
==========

The purpose of this is to allow you to write content that is a placeholder for data, for example '[data_attribute]' could be replaced with a specific value which is labelled "data_attribute", this could be via a table or just specifically designated before the content is outputted. 

I want this to be extendable and fully customisable so whatever your need is, it can be bended a little to fit it, while still being easy to use and configure. 

This is current Pre-Production so keep an eye out for documentation/updates.
